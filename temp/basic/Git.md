# Git 基础

## 进阶

### 写一个好的 commit message

The commit type can include the following:

-   feat 功能 – a new feature is introduced with the changes
-   fix 修复 – a bug fix has occurred
-   chore 琐事 – changes that do not relate to a fix or feature and don't modify src or test files (for example updating dependencies)
-   refactor 重构 – refactored code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
-   docs 文档 – updates to documentation such as a the README or other markdown files
-   style 风格 – changes that do not affect the meaning of the code, likely related to code formatting such as white-space, missing semi-colons, and so on.
-   test 测试 – including new or correcting previous tests
-   perf 性能 – performance improvements
-   ci 持续集成 – continuous integration related
-   build 生成 – changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
