# C 编程技巧

## I/O

### Discard unwanted input

`scanf()` always leave blanks and newline of one line. If the user uses `\n` to stop input, this can make the program exit without confirmation.

-   `getchar()` until the newline

    ```C
    while (getchar() != '\n') continue;
    ```

If `scanf()` doesn't read the value it requires, the input data will be left unused in the buffer, preventing the program to advance. We can discard the wrong value by this method:

-   `scanf()` suppress assignment

    ```C
    while(scanf("%f", &floatNumber) != 1){
        scanf("%*s"); //discard wrong input
        puts("Please use correct input.");
    }
    ```

## Program Control

### Loop Condition

-   arrive the end of file
-   entered the stop signal
-   come to the max length of an array
