# Appendix E: Boolen Algebra and Logic Circuits

## Boolean Algebra

- `'` NOT
- `.` AND
- `+` OR

## Logic Gate

A logic gate is an electronic device that normally takes 1 to N inputs and creates one output.

## Implementation of gates

The most common implementation uses only three gates: NOT, NAND, and NOR. Because a NAND gate uses fewer componenets than an AND gate.

A transistor, when used in gates, behaves like a switch. Several different technologies are used to implement these transistors, include the most known MOSFET.
