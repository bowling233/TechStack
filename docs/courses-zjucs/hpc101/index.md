    - What is HPC and why we need it?
    - What is MPI and how it works?

    Basic ideas can be found in the following materials:
    
    - [Introduction to High Performance Computing for Scientists and Engineers](https://www.crcpress.com/Introduction-to-High-Performance-Computing-for-Scientists-and-Engineers/Chapman/p/book/9781439811924) 
    - [An Introduction to Parallel Programming](http://www.e-tahtam.com/~turgaybilgin/2013-2014-guz/ParalelProgramlama/ParallelProg.pdf).
