!!! note "Newton's Laws"
    
    1. In the absence of external forces, an object at rest remains at rest and an object in motion continues in motion with a constant velocity.
    2. $\sum \mathbf{F} = m \mathbf{a}$
    3. The action force is equal in magnitude to the reaction force and opposite in direction.
    4.

The book mentioned something related to *reference frame*:

- A reference frame requires a **coordinate system** and a set of **clocks**.
- Newton's first law allows us to choose special family of reference frames in which *all* observers would measure the *same* acceleration:

    If the net force acting on a body is zero, then it is possible to find a set of reference frames in which that body has no acceleration.

Next we will explore some form of motions.

- Free Fall
- Projectile Motion

Projectile motion can be seen as free fall. This is an example that **all inertial observers agree on measurements of acceleration**.

??? info "Galilean Transformation"
    
    We can deduce the result that all inertial observers agree on measurements of acceleration using Galilean transformation:

    $\mathbf{r'} = \mathbf{r} - \mathbf{v_0}t$

- Relative Motion in noninertial frames
