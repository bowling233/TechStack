## 零散项目

-   [ ] 重新整理 C 语言笔记

## Coursera: Nand2Tetris

和 BUPT 同学一起学！

这是一门计算机体系结构入门课，从逻辑电路到简易汇编代码，帮助你构建对计算机系统底层的认识。在这个假期，我想我可以抽时间来迅速完成这一门课程。

学习 Web 等开发技术时，牢记这些话：

> Note that all this is just extra reading/done for your own enjoyment/curiosity though and the best policy is to **look stuff up as you develop and you shouldn’t be bother with memorize everything by heart** (you might anyway as you work with a lot of CSS). ——MIT Web Crush

以下是课程设计者的 motivation，也是学习本课程的目标：

> **Why we are teaching this class**
>
> Over the years, we have helped teach several classes at MIT, and over and over we have seen that many students have limited knowledge of the tools available to them. Computers were built to automate manual tasks, yet students often perform repetitive tasks by hand or fail to take full advantage of powerful tools such as version control and text editors. In the best case, this results in inefficiencies and wasted time; in the worst case, it results in issues like data loss or inability to complete certain tasks.
>
> These topics are not taught as part of the university curriculum: students are never shown how to use these tools, or at least not how to use them efficiently, and thus waste time and effort on tasks that _should_ be simple. The standard CS curriculum is missing critical topics about the computing ecosystem that could make students’ lives significantly easier.
