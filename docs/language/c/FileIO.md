## Chapter 13 File Input/Output

> 我们在《C Primer Plus》中学习了 C 标准 I/O 函数。如果继续深入探究，文件输入/输出将涉及与操作系统的交互，这就是 C 标准库所做的事情。

-   Bacis functions
    -   fopen, getc, putc, exit, fclose
    -   fprintf, fscanf, fgets, fputs
    -   rewind, fseek, ftell, fflush
    -   fgetpos, fsetpos, feof, ferror
    -   ungetc, setvbuf, fread, fwrite

### 13.1 Communicating with Files

-   about _line break_
    -   C and Unix: `\n` (the line-feed character)
    -   pre-OS X Macintosh: `\r` (the carriage-return character)
    -   early MS-DOS and Windows Notepad: `\r\n`, with `Ctrl+Z` to denote EOF, pad with null character
    -   **NOTICE:** but in C (text mode), all these things are **mapped** to the C view `\n`
-   Standard Files
    -   standard input/output/error output

### 13.2 Standard I/O

-   input and output are **buffered** (transferred in large chunks)
-   `exit()`: in `stdlib.h`; terminate, _closing any open files_, argument is passed to operating systems
    -   different between `return` and `exit`: exit terminates the program even if called in a function
-   `fopen()`: (address of a string containing file name, open mode)
    -   r, w (truncate exist, create not exist), a (append exist, create not exist)
    -   r+ (r and w), w+ (truncate, r and w), a+ (read all file, only append)
    -   rb, ab+, a+b: binary mode
    -   wx, wbx, wb+x: fail if **already exists**, and open in **exclusive mode**
    -   return: _file pointer_, or **null pointer** if cannot open the file
-   `FILE *`: points to a data object containing information about the file and the buffer
-   `getc(fp)` and `putc(ch, fpout)`: like `getchar()` and `putchar()`
-   **NOTICE:** C discovers it has reached the end of a file **only after it tries to read past the end of the file**, so you should use an **entry-condition loop** (not a do while loop)
-   _dummy value_
-   `fclose(fp)`: close file, flush buffers
    -   return value: 0 (successful), EOF (not succeeded)
    -   example: disk is full, removable storage device has been removed, or there has been an I/O error

### 13.3 A simple-Minded File-condensing Program

### 13.4 File I/O: `fprintf(), fscanf(), fgets()` and `fputs()`

### 13.5 Adventures in Random Access: `fseek()` and `ftell()`

### 13.6 Behind the scenes with Standard I/O

### 13.7 Other Standard I/O Functions
